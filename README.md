# Welcome!

Recommended: [Click here](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffirasm%2Fcapacitor_talk&urlpath=tree%2Fcapacitor_talk%2FCapacitor.ipynb) to download the lecture notes and code along!

The link above will direct you to ubc.syzygy.ca and ask you to authenticate via your CWL. If this is your first time using syzygy, you may have to click on the link twice (apologies)!

### Backup

If you cannot get CWL authentication to work, you can [try using this link](https://pims.syzygy.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffirasm%2Fcapacitor_talk&urlpath=tree%2Fcapacitor_talk%2FCapacitor.ipynb) to authenticate with a Google Account
